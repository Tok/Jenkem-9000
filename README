Jenkem-9000 is a Web-Application to convert Images into IRC-style HTML&CSS.

Jenkem-9000 is running at: http://jenkem9000.appspot.com
Project page: http://tok.github.com/Jenkem-9000/

When finished it will have about the same functionality as: http://github.com/Tok/jenkem
But instead of running an IRC-Bot, this Version will focus on the HTML/CSS part.

This application is implemented using GWT to run on Googles App-Engine.
It is using the library appengine-utils-client to store long Text.

Issues:
-- Doesn't work in IE
