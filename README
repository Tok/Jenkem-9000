Jenkem-9000 is a Web-Application to convert Images into IRC-style HTML&CSS.

When finished it will have about the same functionality as: http://github.com/Tok/jenkem
But instead of running an IRC-Bot, this Version will focus on the HTML part.

This application is implemented using GWT to run on Googles App-Engine at: http://jenkem9000.appspot.com
It is currently using the libraries gwt-g2d, which should be raplaced because of depracation
and appengine-utils-client to store long Text.

WARNING: Jenkem-9000 is currently in an infinished state and may therefore yield crappy results compared to the original.

Issues:
-- Doesn't work in IE
