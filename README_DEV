Setup new app:
Login to openshift website and create new app.
Select latest jboss and add the mongodb cartridge.

There is no need to set the mongodb credentials in the code, since they are looked up (in PMS.scala)
Consider to add the rockmongo cartridge to manage mongodb.

Don't clone the openshift repo because the gwt compilation doesn't work with openshift yet.
Instead build the war locally from the pom.xml in this repo and submit it to openshift by sftp.
(there are launchers for eclipse)

Depoly war to local jBoss by running the eclipse laucher or do it manually:
http://127.0.0.1:9990/console/App.html#deployments --> manually submit war from /target
(make sure mongodb is running locally with default settings)
http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Submit to openshift by sftp:
connect to 
sftp://[hexUsername]@[appname]-[namespace].rhcloud.com/app-root/repo/deployments
and submit the ROOT.war from /deployments
Then restart the app using "rhc ctl_app restart" or ssh into the shell and do it there.
